## Job Sources

A derived scraper extracts jobs from the company's own careers listing
(`https://www.betfairromania.ro/jobs`) and its job sitemap (``).

If the careers page changes its DOM structure, update the **selector cascades**
in `config/scraper.json` (primary + fallbacks) — the self-healing cascade in
`scraper/self_healing.py` and the tests in `tests/` mean one broken selector
should not fail a run. Add a test per new fallback level.
